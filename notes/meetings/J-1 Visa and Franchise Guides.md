## Understanding the S - SPACE 

(Meeting with https://github.com/Remy-Reveltek)

How will we give J-1 Visa from USIVA in partnership with INSTAR Lab Research Program? 
INSTAR Lab Inc is a research institute.
The goal is to create a funnel on how the process would look like.

How can USIVA provide J-1? 

We are already accredited so we can provide J-1 Visa right now.
From openAI, "A research company can sponsor a candidate for a J-1 visa by acting as the host organization for the candidate's research program. To do this, the company must first apply for and receive approval from the US Department of State to become a designated sponsor for the J-1 Research Scholar and Professor program. Once approved, the company can then invite a foreign researcher to come to the US to participate in a research program at the company. The researcher must have the necessary qualifications and be coming to the US for the purpose of conducting research, teaching, or observing in their field of expertise.The company will need to provide the researcher with a written offer of employment or invitation letter, and the researcher will need to apply for the J-1 visa at a US embassy or consulate. The company will also need to provide the researcher with any necessary support, including information on housing and health insurance, as well as completing the necessary forms and paperwork for the J-1 visa application process."

From openAI, here is an A-to-Z process chart outlining the steps involved in obtaining a J-1 visa through a research company:

A) INSTAR Lab Inc. company applies for and receives approval to become a designated sponsor for the J-1 Research Scholar and Professor program.

- [ ] Work on getting approved by the State Department

B) INSTAR Lab Inc. invites a foreign researcher to participate in a research program at the company.

C) INSTAR Lab Inc. provides researcher with a written offer of employment or invitation letter.

- [ ] Create a written offer of employment or invitation letter

D) Researcher applies for a J-1 visa at a US embassy or consulate.

E) INSTAR Lab Inc. provides necessary support and information to the researcher, including housing and health insurance.

- [ ] Create a document that shows support and information for the researcher.

F) INSTAR Lab Inc. completes necessary forms and paperwork for the J-1 visa application process.

G) Researcher attends an interview at the US embassy or consulate.

H) Researcher's J-1 visa application is approved.

I) Researcher travels to the US to begin the research program at the INSTAR Lab Inc.

J) INSTAR Lab Inc. provides ongoing support and supervision to the researcher during the program.

K) Researcher completes the research program and returns to their home country.

For students without bachelor's degree, how can we provide J-1? 

- [ ] Need a profile of the people and on the business. Do they match?

From openAI: In order to qualify for a J-1 visa, individuals must have a foreign degree or professional certificate or be enrolled in a university outside the U.S. In other words, it is generally not possible to obtain a J-1 visa if you do not have a bachelor's degree or equivalent. There may be some exceptions to this requirement for certain types of exchange programs, such as summer work and travel programs, but these programs typically have different eligibility requirements.

## Plan Of Action

- [ ] Talk to client for the program, can be B-1, serves a starting convo and will reach out again to give more information.

- [ ] Research, why INSTAR is suitable for the program?

- [ ] Research, what is the professional certificate? Look up the criteria for that. Is this a viable option for us and how?

- [ ] Reach out to 2-3 college/university (previous classmates) if they're interested for the J-1 Program focused on the Interstellar research or lab development.
