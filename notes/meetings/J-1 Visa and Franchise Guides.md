How will we give J-1 Visa from USIVA in partnership with INSTAR Lab Research Program? 
INSTAR Lab Inc is a research institute.
The goal is to create a funnel on how the process would look like.

How can USIVA provide J-1? 

We are already accredited so we can provide J-1 Visa right now.
From openAI, "A research company can sponsor a candidate for a J-1 visa by acting as the host organization for the candidate's research program. To do this, the company must first apply for and receive approval from the US Department of State to become a designated sponsor for the J-1 Research Scholar and Professor program.Once approved, the company can then invite a foreign researcher to come to the US to participate in a research program at the company. The researcher must have the necessary qualifications and be coming to the US for the purpose of conducting research, teaching, or observing in their field of expertise.The company will need to provide the researcher with a written offer of employment or invitation letter, and the researcher will need to apply for the J-1 visa at a US embassy or consulate. The company will also need to provide the researcher with any necessary support, including information on housing and health insurance, as well as completing the necessary forms and paperwork for the J-1 visa application process."

From openAI, here is an A-to-Z process chart outlining the steps involved in obtaining a J-1 visa through a research company:
