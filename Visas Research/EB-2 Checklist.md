**Prong III** - Requires the peitioner to,

  * demonstrate that the individual presents a national benefit so great as to outweigh the national interest inherent in the labor certification process

  * establish that the individual will serve the national interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications

  * clearly establish that the alien’s past record justifies projections of future benefit to the national interest
