This is a cheklist based on the three prongs from  the <a href="https://www.eb2niw.com/matter-of-dhanasar-new-rules-for-niw/">Dhanasar Case</a>.

**Prong I** - A petitioner has shown that the area of employment is of **substantial intrinsic merit**.

**Prong II** - A petitioner must establish that any proposed benefit from the individualâ€™s endeavors will be **national in scope**.

**Prong III** - Requires the peitioner to,
  * demonstrate that the national interest would be adversely affected if a labor certification were required

  * demonstrate that the individual presents a national benefit so great as to outweigh the national interest inherent in the labor certification process

  * establish that the individual will serve the national interest to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications

  * clearly establish that the alienâ€™s past record justifies projections of future benefit to the national interest
