Applicants must demonstrate extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or must demonstrate that they possess a superior level of expertise in their profession.

The first prong, substantial merit and national importance, focuses on the specific endeavor that the 
foreign national proposes to undertake. A petitioner must establish that any proposed benefit from the individual‚Äôs endeavors will be **national in scope**. The endeavor's merit may be demonstrated in a range of 
areas such as business, entrepreneurialism, science, technology, culture, health, or education. In 
determining whether the proposed endeavor has national importance, we consider its potential 
prospective impact. </td>

            <td colspan=3>To determine whether you are well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor, we consider factors including, but not limited to: the individual‚Äôs education, skills, knowledge and record of success in related or similar efforts; a model or plan for future activities; any progress towards achieving the proposed endeavor; and the interest of potential customers, users, investors, or other relevant entities or individuals. We recognize that forecasting feasibility or future success may present challenges to petitioners and USCIS officers, and that many innovations and entrepreneurial endeavors may ultimately fail, in whole or in part, despite an intelligent plan and competent execution. We do not, therefore, require petitioners to demonstrate that their endeavors are more likely than not to ultimately succeed. But notwithstanding this inherent uncertainty, in order to merit a national interest waiver, petitioners must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they are well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.</td>

            <td colspan=3>This prong allows immigrants to bypass the labor certification process and receive their visa without demonstrating that there are no qualified U.S. workers available. Applicants must demonstrate that their presence in the U.S. is in the national interest and that they are able to make an exceptional contribution to their field.

The third prong requires the petitioner to demonstrate that, on balance, it would be beneficial to the 
United States to waive the requirements of a job offer and thus of a labor certification. In 
performing this analysis, USCIS may evaluate factors such as: whether, in light of the nature of the 
foreign national's qualifications or the proposed endeavor, it would be impractical either for the 
foreign national to secure a job offer or for the petitioner to obtain a labor certification; whether, even assuming that other qualified U.S. workers are available, the United States would still benefit 
from the foreign national's contributions; and whether the national interest in the foreign national's 
contributions is sufficiently urgent to warrant forgoing the labor certification process. In each case, 
the factor(s) considered must, taken together, indicate that on balance, it would be beneficial to the 
United States to waive the requirements of a job offer and thus of a labor certification.

Requires the peitioner to:
  * demonstrate that the national interest would be adversely affected if a labor certification were required
  * demonstrate that the individual presents a national benefit so great as to outweigh the national interest inherent in the labor certification process
  * establish that the individual will serve the national importance to a substantially greater degree than would an available U.S. worker having the same minimum qualifications
  * clearly establish that the alien‚Äôs past record justifies projections of future benefit to the national importance</td>
