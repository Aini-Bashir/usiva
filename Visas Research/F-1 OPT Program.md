# The F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT) Program
- [According to USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-opt-for-f-1-students), Optional Practical Training (OPT) is temporary employment that is directly related to an F-1 studentâ€™s major area of study. Eligible students can apply to receive up to 12 months of OPT employment authorization before completing their academic studies (pre-completion) and/or after completing their academic studies (post-completion). However, all periods of pre-completion OPT will be deducted from the available period of post-completion OPT.

- It is a benefit for international students in the United States on an F-1 visa. It allows these students to work in a job related to their field of study for up to 12 months after completing their program of study. The purpose of OPT is to provide students with practical experience in their field and to help bridge the gap between academic studies and professional work. Students can apply for OPT before or after completing their studies, and they can apply for an extension of the OPT period for certain STEM fields. It is important to note that the rules and regulations for the OPT program are subject to change and it is best to consult with a [USIVA](https://usiva.org/) for the most up-to-date information.
